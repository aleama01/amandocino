Welcome to the repository for [www.amandocino.com](http://www.amandocino.com), my personal website showcasing my writing, projects, and the amazing work of my friends. This site is built using Next.js, TailwindCSS and Hygraph

## Overview

This website is used to post everything I do not want to share on my social media accounts, including:
- Written reflections or stories that happened to me.
- Showcases of my friends creative works.
- Information about all the projects I have worked on.
- Photos of the places I visit.
